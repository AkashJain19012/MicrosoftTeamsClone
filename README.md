Create an Account and Obtain an App ID
To build and run the sample application, first obtain an app ID:

Create a developer account at agora.io. Once you finish the sign-up process, you are redirected to the dashboard.
Navigate in the dashboard tree on the left to Projects > Project List.
Copy the app ID that you obtain from the dashboard into a text file. You will use this when you launch the app.
